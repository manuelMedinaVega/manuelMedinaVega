# Hi, I'm Manuel Medina 👋  

## About Me  
I am a **Computer Science Engineer** graduated from **Universidad Nacional de Trujillo**.  
My passion for software development has taken me from building desktop applications in **Java** and **Android mobile apps** to specializing in **web development with PHP**, where I have been working for over 7 years.  

Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in various technologies and tools, including:  
- **Database analysis and design**  
- **Frontend and backend frameworks**  
- **Testing**  
- **Web application deployment**  

My curiosity and willingness to keep learning led me to pursue a **Master’s in Data Science** at the **Universidad de Buenos Aires**, where I developed skills in **data analysis** and extracting valuable knowledge for **decision-making**. I am currently in the process of completing my thesis.  

My objective is to continue learning, challenging myself, and delivering my best in every project I take part in, while contributing to the success of the teams I work with.
